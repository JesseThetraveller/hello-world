Hi there,

I recently found my love for coding and creating cool stuff with it.
Next to my Full-Time job iam studiying in the evenings for my bachelor and Iam trying
to spent as much time as I can into coding.
By the last quarter of the year 2018 I will fully keep on working as a Freelancer
and will have even more time to get into it:)

See you around,
Jesse
